# jmws_wp_vqsg_ot_idMyGadget-experimental

Copy of code used to try adding idMyGadget to Our Theme.

This repo was created because we ran into issues trying to rename the directory containing the theme.

This code is essentially obsolete; see the current repo [jmws_wp_idmygadget_vqsg_ot](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_wp_idmygadget_vqsg_ot) for the current code.
